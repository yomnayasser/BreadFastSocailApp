# Getting Started


## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:


# using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

# using Yarn
yarn android

### For ios

# using Yarn
yarn ios
```



### App Structure 
The app contains 3 screens: Splash, Home and Post Details screen
### Design Methodology 
I used the Atomic Design Methodology where I divded the components to three groups: atoms, molecules and organisms
### Libraries used
for theming:react-native-theming
for icons:react-native-vector-icons
for skeletons:react-native-skeleton-placeholder
for animation:lottie-react-native
for api handling:@tanstack/react-quer
